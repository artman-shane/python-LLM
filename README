To access the command line interface, run the application "commandLineInterface.py" by issuing the command:
`python3 commandLineInterface.py`

You will be required to input a filename which must be a file in Documents.

.env configuration
ensure that .env is populated using the .env.example as an example.

To read in PDF or XLS for questions to format and output into XLSX:
`python3 createXLSfromQuestionnaire.py`

usage: <python3 createXLSfromQuestionnaire.py [-pq or --processQuestions | -h or --help | -lp or --llmPrompt]>
-h = Help
-pq = Process questions while running.
-lp = Add prompt to adjust LLM prompting

example:
<python3 createXLSfromQuestionnaire.py -pq -lp Pay attention to the choices for how to answer questions if it has relavent values.>

Notes:
Questions File: When reading the xlsx:

Ensure that the first row is the header row. You can specify another row but this needs to be consistent throughout the sheets you are getting the tool to read.
While it does not matter the number of columns or rows, any colums that are missing data or missing headers will make it more difficult to understand the question.
We use the fields to populate the LLM so the more succinct the better. You can also add your own instructions using the llmPrompt feature.
An example of a question file would include the following columns:

    ID: Question ID to be used to update the question
    Question: Question to be asked
    Description: A description of the question including relevant answer choices
    Choices: Potential relevant answer choices

While it is not strictly necessary it will help to direct the answers from the LLM.

Answers File - The Answer File is used to provide knowledge to the LLM. This will be used to answers the questions you provide.
The answers file should be clear. Currently we are using the SIG lite document for 2024. You can specify this file and have the LLM answer the questions while processing.
You should ensure that the Twilio SIG lite document (current version is 2024) is loaded into the Documents folder.
