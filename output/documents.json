Messages are delivered using random approved domestic shortcodes.International customers do not need to register; messages are by default sent and delivered via international connections to Malaysia mobile operators. Messages are also delivered using random approved shortcodes.Effective September 1, 2024,\\u00a0all SMS messages sent to Malaysia that contain any of the following content in the message body will be blocked:Mobile or fixed-line phone numbersRequests for a person\\u2019s personal information (e.g. name, identification number, card number, bank account number, etc.)URLsPreviously, customers could send SMS messages containing URLs and phone numbers if they were registered with Twilio before sending. Due to updated regulations to combat fraud, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) is now restricting the content of SMS messages sent to Malaysian mobile subscribers.In addition, sending firearms, gambling, adult content, money/loan, political, religious, controlled substance, cannabis, and alcohol related content is strictly prohibited.Sending marketing and promotional messages between 8PM to 8AM is prohibited.Malaysian mobile operators require the content header\\u00a0RM 0.00 to be added to every message sent to Malaysia. This header informs the receiving subscriber that they were not charged for receiving the SMS message. Sending your messages without this header will result in the content being truncated or the message failing entirely.You must also include your brand name to avoid blocking and filtering by mobile operators. Brand names in message content allow mobile operators to identify which organizations are sending messages to their subscribers. The Sender ID of A2P messages to Malaysia is overwritten with a Shortcode Sender ID.Per local regulations, only Person-to-Person (P2P) messages may be sent via Malaysian domestic long codes. If you can guarantee that you only send legitimate P2P messages, please reach out to Twilio Customer Services to ensure the proper domestic long code connectivity is enabled on your account. For Application-to-Person (A2P) messages, you can use any international long codes.Concatenated messages are supported by all mobile operators except Digi Malaysia which delivers them as multiple separate messages.Twilio strongly encourages customers to review proposed use cases with qualified legal counsel to make sure that they comply with all applicable laws.

You must have a license from the State Bank of Vietnam to send finance-related content via Sender ID. Delivery reports are SMSC-acknowledgment only and are not guaranteed.
