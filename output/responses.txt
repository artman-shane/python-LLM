The Cloud Infrastructure team creates standard hardened images which engineering teams use to boot their instances. Systems and applications are regularly patched as part of Twilio's development and deployment cycle. Critical patches are evaluated and applied proactively, generally within two weeks for high-risk patches, deploying directly to nodes through internally developed tools for immediate threats.

The Information Security Management System (ISMS) at Twilio ensures detailed documentation and availability of tools for securing key infrastructures against potential threats. Details about particular resources and recommended practices for specific areas may be restricted and available under confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.

Question: 2.24 Documentation regarding the process for reviewing, revoking or disabling access to inactive accounts, including a sample user access report *
Answer: Regarding the process for reviewing, revoking, or disabling access to inactive accounts, Twilio implements mechanisms to ensure appropriate management of user lifecycle. The following points summarize the specific practices:

1. **Documentation of Process:** Twilio maintains a rigorous process for managing user access which includes reviewing, revoking, or disabling access to inactive accounts. This is part of the broader access control policy that Twilio enforces to secure its systems and data.

2. **Sample User Access Report:** As part of its internal compliance and security procedures, Twilio generates user access reports. These reports typically contain details about user activities, access levels, and account status. As part of maintaining information security and user privacy, these reports help in identifying inactive accounts that may need attention for revocation or disabling to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Review and Revocation Procedure:** Access rights are reviewed periodically (at a minimum annually) to ensure that they are still appropriate. When an account is found to be inactive or if the user changes roles or leaves the company, access rights are promptly adjusted or terminated according to the documented process.

4. **Formal Approval and Documentation:** Changes to access rights, including revocation for inactive accounts, are formally approved and documented. This ensures an audit trail is available for compliance and security audits.

For further detailed documents related to these processes, including obtaining a sample user access report, interested parties must undergo a formal request process due to the sensitive nature of the information.
